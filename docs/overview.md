## Niagaros Documentation Hub

This file is the entry point for navigating all Niagaros documentation.

- `internal/` – private engineering, security, and R&D documentation. Includes
  architecture deep dives, integration details, environment policies, features,
  and research drafts.
- `public/` – customer-facing docs such as platform overviews, user guides,
  onboarding flows, and support resources.
- `partner/` – material tailored for resellers, integrators, and technology
  partners (integration guides, sales enablement, technical requirements).
- `Images/` – shared visual assets (architecture diagrams, UI mockups) used by
  the docs above.

Every major directory contains its own `overview.md` for more context. Start at
the folder relevant to your audience (internal, public, partner) and work your
way down.
