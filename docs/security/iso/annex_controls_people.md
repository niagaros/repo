## Introduction to Annex A – People Controls (A.6)

Annex A.6 of ISO 27001:2022 focuses on the human aspect of information security. These **people controls** ensure that employees, contractors, and third parties understand their responsibilities and act in a secure and compliant manner throughout their lifecycle with the organization.

The purpose of A.6 is to:

- Ensure appropriate **screening and background checks** before granting access
- Establish **confidentiality obligations** that continue even after employment ends
- Provide ongoing **security awareness and training** so personnel understand risks
- Define a clear **disciplinary process** for violations or misconduct
- Ensure secure **onboarding and offboarding** to prevent unauthorized access

These controls help minimize risks caused by human error, negligence, or misuse. Completing the checklist below ensures your organization’s people-related security measures comply with ISO 27001 requirements.
