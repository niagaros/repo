## Introduction to ISMS Setup

The ISMS Setup phase forms the foundation of ISO 27001 and establishes all essential building blocks of the Information Security Management System. This stage defines what the ISMS will cover, how risks will be managed, and who is responsible for maintaining information security within the organization.

The goal of ISMS Setup is to:

- Define the **scope** and boundaries of the ISMS  
- Understand the organization’s **context**, processes, and stakeholders  
- Assign **roles and responsibilities** for information security  
- Establish the **Information Security Policy** and guiding principles  
- Create a **risk assessment methodology** and perform a full risk assessment  
- Develop a **risk treatment plan** aligned with business priorities  
- Prepare the **Statement of Applicability (SoA)** documenting all selected Annex A controls  

This phase ensures your ISMS has a strong structure, clear governance, and a consistent approach to managing information security risks. Once completed, the organization can move confidently into documentation, implementation, and auditing.
