## Introduction to Annex A – Physical Controls (A.7)

Annex A.7 of ISO 27001:2022 covers the **physical security controls** required to protect information assets from unauthorized physical access, damage, loss, or interference. These controls ensure that the organization’s buildings, equipment, and workspaces remain secure and resilient.

The purpose of A.7 is to:

- Control and monitor **physical entry** to sensitive areas
- Protect equipment and facilities from **environmental threats**, tampering, and theft
- Manage **visitor access** and ensure proper escorting and logging
- Prevent unauthorized removal or misuse of **devices, hardware, and media**
- Establish secure procedures for **asset disposal** and decommissioning

These controls help safeguard the physical environment where information is stored, processed, or accessed. Completing this checklist ensures your organization meets ISO 27001 physical security requirements.
