# Audit Evidence Collection Checklist  
(Step 4: Gathering Audit Evidence)

This checklist helps to ensure that sufficient and appropriate evidence is collected to demonstrate compliance with ISO 27001 requirements and Annex A controls.

## Evidence Identification

| Control Point | Check | How to Verify |
|----------------|--------|--------------|
- [ ] |  Has evidence been identified for each control or requirement? | Compare the evidence list with the Annex A checklist or audit scope. |
| Is the type of evidence appropriate (documented, digital, interview, observation)? | [ ] | Validate that evidence matches audit criteria and provides proof (not assumptions or statements). |
| Is the evidence relevant to the current version of the control or policy? | [ ] | Check version numbers, approval dates, and whether evidence matches the latest revision. |

## Evidence Collection

| Control Point | Check | How to Verify |
|----------------|--------|--------------|
| Has the evidence been collected from reliable sources (document management system, screenshots, system exports)? | [ ] | Verify the source and ensure the evidence comes from official systems. |
| Is evidence stored securely and with controlled access? | [ ] | Check access permissions or dedicated audit evidence storage location. |
| Is the evidence complete (not just partial screenshots or excerpts)? | [ ] | Ensure the evidence shows the full context (not cropped or filtered). |
| Is the evidence reproducible (can it be gathered again if necessary)? | [ ] | Validate that the evidence can be re-generated (e.g., reports, screenshots). |

## Evidence Validation

| Control Point | Check | How to Verify |
|----------------|--------|--------------|
| Has the authenticity of the evidence been confirmed? | [ ] | Validate timestamps, metadata, audit logs, or system tags. |
| Is the evidence sufficient to prove the control is effective (not just exists)? | [ ] | Assess whether the evidence demonstrates *actual use*, not just documents. |
| Has the auditor confirmed that no conflicting evidence exists? | [ ] | Cross-check different sources (e.g., policy vs system logs). |

## Documentation and Traceability

| Control Point | Check | How to Verify |
|----------------|--------|--------------|
| Is each piece of evidence linked to a control or requirement? | [ ] | Reference ID (e.g., “A.8.7 – Vulnerability management – Evidence #04”). |
| Has evidence been added to the audit evidence tracker / folder structure? | [ ] | Confirm evidence is stored in the correct audit folder with IDs. |
| Is the evidence labeled clearly (title, date, source, author)? | [ ] | Check file naming convention and metadata. |
| Is the evidence easy to locate for external auditors? | [ ] | Validate folder structure and indexing; perform a quick find test. |

---

## Storage and Retention

| Control Point | Check | How to Verify |
|----------------|--------|--------------|
| Is there a defined retention period for audit evidence? | [ ] | Review ISMS documentation or audit procedures. |
| Does evidence storage respect data protection/legal requirements (e.g., GDPR)? | [ ] | Validate access restrictions and legal basis for storing evidence. |
| Are old or obsolete evidence items archived or removed? | [ ] | Check archive procedures or deletion logs. |
