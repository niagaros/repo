## Introduction to Operational Security

Operational Security in ISO 27001 focuses on the day-to-day activities required to protect information, detect threats, and respond effectively to security incidents. These controls ensure that security is not just documented but actively practiced and monitored across the organization.

The purpose of operational security is to:

- Maintain effective **monitoring**, **logging**, and **alerting**  
- Ensure **vulnerability management**, **patching**, and **technical maintenance**  
- Enable a consistent and rapid **incident response process**  
- Protect information through **backup**, **recovery**, and **operational procedures**  
- Ensure changes follow a controlled **change management** workflow  
- Detect and respond to security events before they escalate  

These activities form the operational backbone of the ISMS, ensuring protection is continuous, repeatable, and measurable. Completing the checklist below helps verify that your organization’s operational security controls meet ISO 27001 requirements.
