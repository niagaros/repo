## Introduction to Annex A – Technological Controls (A.8)

Annex A.8 of ISO 27001:2022 focuses on the **technical controls** required to protect information systems, networks, and applications from security threats. These controls ensure that the organization applies secure technologies, implements proper safeguards, and maintains ongoing protection through monitoring and maintenance.

The purpose of A.8 is to:

- Implement **access controls**, strong authentication, and system hardening
- Protect systems using **malware defenses**, secure configurations, and timely patching
- Ensure secure **development practices** and change management
- Enable effective **logging, monitoring, and detection** of security events
- Safeguard data through **encryption**, backups, and secure network architecture
- Identify and address vulnerabilities via **scanning**, testing, and remediation

These technological safeguards form the core of the organization’s security posture, ensuring systems remain resilient against attacks and failures. Completing this checklist ensures alignment with ISO 27001’s technical security requirements.
