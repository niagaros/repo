## Introduction to Annex A – Organizational Controls (A.5)

Annex A.5 of ISO 27001:2022 defines the **organizational-level controls** needed to support a secure and well-governed Information Security Management System (ISMS). These controls ensure that information security is embedded into the company’s **policies, processes, governance structure, and overall culture**.

The focus of A.5 is to:

- Establish clear **policies** for information security
- Assign and communicate **roles, responsibilities, and authorities**
- Manage **governance**, including contact with regulators and industry groups
- Integrate security into **projects, planning, and daily operations**
- Ensure **access control rules** are formally defined and enforced

These controls create the foundation for how an organization manages security at a strategic and operational level. Completing the checklist below will help ensure your organization meets the requirements of A.5.
