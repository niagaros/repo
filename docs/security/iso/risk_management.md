## 3. Risk Management Objectives
Risk Management must ensure:

| Objective | Definition |
|----------|-------------|
| **Identification** | Risks are identified early and proactively |
| **Assessment** | Probability, impact, and severity are evaluated objectively |
| **Treatment** | Risks are reduced, avoided, transferred, or accepted |
| **Monitoring** | Risks are reviewed regularly and updated |

---

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|

|------|------|--------|--------|
| 5 | Evaluate probability (Low/Medium/High) |  |
| 6 | Evaluate impact (Low/Medium/High) |  |
| 7 | Calculate risk severity (Probability × Impact) |  |
| 8 | Determine risk level (Low / Medium / High / Critical) |  |

---

### C. Treat / Mitigate Risks

| Step | Task | Owner | Status |
