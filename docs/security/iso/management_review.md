##  Introduction to Management Review

Management Review is a required process in ISO 27001 that ensures top management evaluates the performance, effectiveness, and strategic alignment of the Information Security Management System (ISMS). This review helps confirm that the ISMS continues to support the organization’s objectives and that sufficient resources, direction, and improvements are in place.

During the management review, leadership assesses:

- Results of internal audits  
- Security incidents and response actions  
- Risk assessment updates  
- Progress on ISMS objectives and KPIs  
- Nonconformities and corrective actions  
- Performance of implemented controls  
- Adequacy of staffing, tools, and resources  
- Opportunities for improvement  

A thorough and well-documented management review demonstrates strong leadership commitment and ensures the ISMS is continually improving and ready for ISO 27001 certification.
