## Introduction to Internal Audit

The Internal Audit process is a critical component of ISO 27001 and ensures that the Information Security Management System (ISMS) is functioning effectively and complies with all requirements of the standard. Internal audits help identify gaps, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement before the external certification audit takes place.

The purpose of the internal audit is to:

- Verify that the ISMS is implemented and operating correctly  
- Confirm compliance with ISO 27001 requirements and internal policies  
- Identify nonconformities, risks, and process deviations  
- Provide management with insight into system performance  
- Support continuous improvement through corrective actions  

A well-planned internal audit program demonstrates maturity, transparency, and readiness for certification. Completing the checklist below helps ensure your internal audits meet ISO 27001 expectations.
