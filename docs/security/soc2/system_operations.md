# System Operations 
System Operations focuses on ensuring that systems are managed securely, reliably, and efficiently on a day-to-day basis. This SOC 2 criterion requires organizations to monitor system performance, detect and respond to incidents, manage vulnerabilities, and apply patches or updates in a controlled manner. It also includes handling system alerts, maintaining operational procedures, and ensuring that services remain stable and resilient. Effective system operations reduce downtime, improve reliability, and help quickly identify and resolve issues.
