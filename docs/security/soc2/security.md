# Security 
Security is the foundational SOC 2 criterion and applies to every audit. It ensures that systems and data are protected against unauthorized access, misuse, and security threats. This includes implementing strong authentication, enforcing least privilege, applying network protections, maintaining secure configurations, and monitoring for suspicious activity. Effective security controls reduce the risk of breaches and establish a reliable baseline for all other SOC 2 trust service criteria.

- [ ] Authentication and authorization controls
