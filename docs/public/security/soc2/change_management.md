# Change Management 
Change Management ensures that all modifications to systems, applications, and infrastructure are controlled, reviewed, and implemented safely. This SOC 2 criterion requires organizations to follow a structured process that includes documenting changes, reviewing and approving updates, testing in non-production environments, and maintaining clear audit trails. Effective change management reduces the risk of errors, outages, and security issues caused by unauthorized or untested changes.
