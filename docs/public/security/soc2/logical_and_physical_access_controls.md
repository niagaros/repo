# Logical and Physical Access Controls 
Logical and Physical Access Controls ensure that only authorized individuals can access systems, data, and physical facilities. This SOC 2 criterion requires strong authentication measures, role-based access, multi-factor authentication, secure device management, and regular access reviews. It also covers physical safeguards such as badges, locked facilities, and monitoring of entry points. Together, these controls prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive information from both digital and physical threats.
