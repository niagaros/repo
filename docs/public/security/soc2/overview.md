# SOC 2 Overview

SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2) is a compliance framework designed to ensure that service providers securely manage customer data. It is especially relevant for technology companies, SaaS platforms, and cloud service providers. SOC 2 evaluates whether an organization has effective controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. A successful SOC 2 audit demonstrates that the organization protects customer data and follows industry-standard security practices.

# SOC 2 Requirements Overview (13 Categories)

This document summarizes the 13 core SOC 2 requirement categories defined by the AICPA Trust Services Criteria (TSC). These criteria form the basis for evaluating whether an organization has effective controls to protect customer data.

## Security (Common Criteria)
The foundational requirement for all SOC 2 audits. Ensures systems are protected against unauthorized access through controls such as authentication, access control, firewalls, and monitoring.

## Availability
Ensures systems and services remain accessible according to commitments. Includes uptime monitoring, capacity planning, redundancy, and disaster recovery measures.

## Processing Integrity
Ensures that data processing is accurate, complete, authorized, and timely. Covers quality control, validation, change reviews, and error handling in applications and services.

## Confidentiality
Ensures sensitive information is protected from unauthorized disclosure. Requires encryption, strict access control, secure storage, and proper data disposal.

## Privacy
Focuses on the protection of personal data. Requires proper collection, use, retention, disposal, and transparency practices, along with honoring user privacy rights.

## Control Environment
Defines the organizational structure, roles, responsibilities, and overall commitment to security and compliance. Includes leadership involvement and ethical standards.

## Communication & Information

## Monitoring Activities
Ensures controls are monitored, evaluated, and improved over time. Involves internal audits, metrics tracking, issue remediation, and continuous improvement.

## Logical and Physical Access Controls
Ensures both digital and physical access to systems and data are restricted to authorized individuals. Includes MFA, RBAC, endpoint protection, and facility controls.

## System Operations
Covers operational safeguards such as logging, monitoring, vulnerability management, incident detection, and system performance management.

## Change Management
Ensures changes to systems, code, or infrastructure follow an approved, tested, and documented process. Includes separation of duties and version control.

## Vendor / Third-Party Management
Requires oversight of external suppliers that may impact security. Includes vendor risk assessments, contracts with security obligations, and periodic reviews.
