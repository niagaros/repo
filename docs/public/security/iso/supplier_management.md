## Introduction to Supplier Management

Supplier Management in ISO 27001 ensures that third-party vendors, service providers, and partners who access or process organizational information do so securely. Because suppliers can introduce significant risks, ISO 27001 requires organizations to assess, monitor, and manage supplier relationships throughout their lifecycle.

The purpose of supplier management is to:

- Identify and document all **suppliers** involved in information processing  
- Perform **risk assessments** to determine the security impact of each supplier  
- Define and enforce **security requirements** in contracts and agreements  
- Continuously **monitor supplier performance**, compliance, and certifications  
- Ensure suppliers report security incidents and meet agreed-upon controls  
- Review suppliers regularly to confirm they remain trustworthy and secure  

Effective supplier management reduces third-party risk and ensures outsourced services uphold the organization’s information security standards. Completing the checklist below helps verify compliance with ISO 27001 requirements.
