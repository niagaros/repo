## Introduction to Certification Readiness

The Certification Readiness phase ensures your organization is fully prepared for the formal ISO 27001 certification audit. At this stage, all documentation, controls, evidence, and processes must be complete, consistent, and functioning as intended.

This part of the checklist confirms that:

- All Annex A controls are addressed and supported by evidence  
- Internal audits and management reviews have been completed  
- Corrective actions from internal audits are resolved
