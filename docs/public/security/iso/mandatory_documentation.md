## Introduction to Mandatory Documentation

ISO 27001 requires a set of mandatory documents and records to ensure the Information Security Management System (ISMS) is properly defined, implemented, and maintained. These documents provide structure, clarity, and evidence that your organization is meeting the requirements of the standard.

The purpose of mandatory documentation is to:

- Establish the **policies**, **procedures**, and **processes** that define how the ISMS operates  
- Ensure **consistent implementation** across the organization  
- Provide **evidence** for internal and external audits  
- Support effective **risk management** and **control selection**  
- Demonstrate compliance with ISO 27001 requirements  

Having accurate, approved, and up-to-date documentation is essential before undergoing certification. Completing the checklist below helps confirm that your ISMS includes all required ISO 27001 documents.
