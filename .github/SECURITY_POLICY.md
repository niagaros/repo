## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report the issue privately by:
- Emailing the Niagaros security contact, or
- Using the officially designated private contact channel

Please include the following details where possible:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected components, endpoints, or versions
- Potential impact and severity
- Proof-of-concept code, logs, or screenshots (if available)

Clear and detailed reports help us respond faster and more effectively.

## What to Expect
After submitting a security report:

### Acknowledgement
We aim to acknowledge receipt within **72 hours**.

### Investigation
We will investigate and assess the issue’s impact and severity.

### Fix & Mitigation
We will prioritize fixes based on risk and complexity.

### Disclosure
We may coordinate responsible disclosure with the reporter once a fix is released.

Please **do not publicly disclose** the issue before this process is complete.

## Responsible Disclosure
We ask security researchers to:

- Act in good faith
- Avoid accessing or modifying user data
- Avoid service disruption
- Limit testing to what is necessary to demonstrate the issue
- Allow reasonable time for remediation before public disclosure

Following these guidelines helps keep users and the community safe.
